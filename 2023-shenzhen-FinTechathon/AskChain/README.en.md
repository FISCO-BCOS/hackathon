# Blockchain ESG

#### Introduction
{** Blockchain ESG Scoring System ** aims to provide companies with a transparent and traceable solution for assessing ESG (Environmental, Social and governance) projects. 
Allows companies to submit ESG project information, map it to a unique NFT, and receive a score from an ESG evaluator.
This NFT will contain detailed information about the project as well as scores submitted by the ESG assessment body, ensuring that the data is immutable and transparent.
The system will automatically calculate and maintain the total score of the project, 
which can be used as an objective standard of ESG project quality for the reference of governments, banks and other institutions. }
