### Contributing Guide
#### 1 Issue Guidelines

- Issues are exclusively for bug reports, feature requests and design-related topics. Other questions may be closed directly. If any questions come up when you are using Element, please hit [Gitter](https://gitter.im/element-en/Lobby) for help.

- Before submitting an issue, please check if similar problems have already been issued.

#### 2 Pull Request Guidelines

- Fork this repository to your own account. Do not create branches here.

- Commit info should be formatted as `[File Name]: Info about commit.` (e.g. `README.md: Fix xxx bug`)

- <font color=red>Make sure PRs are created to `develop` branch instead of `master` branch.</font>

- If your PR fixes a bug, please provide a description about the related bug.

- Merging a PR takes two maintainers: one approves the changes after reviewing, and then the other reviews and merges.
